#Done Daily

A simple list app that resets every day, comparing you to yourself yesterday. By narrowing the focus, you can always aim to improve. Local storage for now, so there is no server-side syncing or need of profiles. Just use it and return tomorrow from your workstation, phone, or both, for contextual, habitual, ritual to-do conquering.  More of an experiment than anything really.
